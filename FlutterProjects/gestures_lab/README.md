# KeyMotion

A roguelike lock-picking game. The user will have to use custom gestures (recognizing circular patterns and multitouch handling) in order to pick a lock. Each time you pick a lock you win a key. See how many you can get before you lose to the timer. Difficulty will increase each level by adding more combinations to the locks.

This project was developed as part of an article for RWenderlich.
